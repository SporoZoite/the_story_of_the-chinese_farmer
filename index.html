            <h3>The Story</h3>

            
            <p class= firstparagraph>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. </p>
               <p>They said,
                 <blockquote class= "villagers" id="quotation">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</blockquote>
                The farmer said, 
                
                <blockquote class= "farmer" id="quotation"><strong>Maybe.</strong></blockquote></p>
                
                <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, 
                and in the evening everybody came back and said, 
                
                <blockquote class= "villagers" id="quotation">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</blockquote>
                
                The farmer again said, 
                
                <blockquote class= "farmer" id="quotation"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q> </blockquote></p>

                <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. 
                    
                    <br>The neighbors then said, 
                    
                    <blockquote class= "villagers" id="quotation">Oh dear, that’s too <span class= "bad">bad</span></blockquote>

                    
                    and the farmer responded, 
                    
                    <blockquote class= "farmer" id="quotation"><strong>Maybe.</strong></blockquote> </p>
                    
                    <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
                    
                   <br> Again all the neighbors came around and said, 
                    
                    <blockquote class= "villagers" id="quotation">Isn’t that great!</blockquote> 
                    
                    Again, he said, 
                    
                    <blockquote class= "farmer" id="quotation"><strong>Maybe.</strong></q></blockquote></p>
                
                <p> The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, 
                    and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class= "good">good</span> or 
                    <span class= "bad">bad</span> 
                    — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, 
                    you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion </h3>
  <p><span class= "good">good</span> and <span class= "bad">bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
